# Evaluate the performance of differentially private Gaussian Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models

The project code is in the file `main.py` and datasets are in the folder `data`. To run the `main.py` file, we use the following command: `./run.sh model_name dataset`. The supplementary file `dataset.py` is used for exploring the characteristics of datasets. This piece of information is important for our research.

For example, to run the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) classifier on the "wine" dataset, we use the command: `./run.sh gnb wine`. In addition, to run the Logistic Regression classifier on the "rice" dataset, we use the command: `./run.sh logit rice`.
